# Muse Chat â€“ Project Context

This file captures the simplified development workflow and current feature set, so it can be used to re-establish context in future chats or documentation.

---

## ðŸ”€ Workflow
- **Branches**:
  - `main` â†’ always stable, used for releases
  - `feature` â†’ active development only

- **Cycle**:
  1. Do all development on `feature`
  2. Merge `feature` into `main` only when stable
  3. Tag releases on `main`:
     ```bash
     git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z: description"
     git push origin vX.Y.Z
     ```

- **Docs** in repo:
  - `README.md` â†’ overview
  - `.github/pull_request_template.md` â†’ squash-merge checklist
  - `CHANGELOG.md` â†’ manual notes
  - `docs/release-template.md` â†’ GitHub release boilerplate
  - `docs/WORKFLOW.md` â†’ step-by-step guide
  - `docs/QUICKREF.md` â†’ one-page cheat sheet

ðŸ‘‰ All stage/milestone process (stage6.x-dev, issue bundles, milestone templates) has been retired.

## ðŸ’¡ Current Feature Set
